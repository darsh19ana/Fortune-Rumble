# Fortune-Rumble
This Python project is a simple text-based slot machine game that allows users to simulate playing a slot machine. The game prompts the user to deposit an initial amount, choose the number of lines to bet on, and the bet amount per line. The slot machine then generates a random spin, and the user can win or lose based on the matching symbols on the chosen lines.
